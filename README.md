# MENTOR Agent

## Overview

MENTOR (Market Execution & Navigation Through Optimized Reasoning) is a personal investment agent platform that learns each user's unique investment philosophy and executes it perfectly on their behalf. Unlike traditional robo-advisors or trading platforms that impose specific strategies, MENTOR begins with sophisticated financial capabilities but zero investment philosophy, adapting to any user's approach through conversation, demonstration, and feedback.

## Core Value Proposition

MENTOR solves the universal tension in investment technology through:

1. **Philosophy Agnosticism**: Adapts to any investment approach rather than imposing a specific strategy
2. **Execution Translation**: Converts simple investment ideas into perfectly executed trades
3. **Emotional Discipline**: Maintains the user's strategy during market volatility
4. **Time Liberation**: Monitors markets 24/7 for opportunities matching user criteria
5. **Learning Partnership**: Continuously improves understanding of user preferences

## Project Structure

The MENTOR agent is developed following the agent-oriented iAI framework, with six core workstreams:

1. **Agent Foundation**: Core architecture, memory systems, and learning framework
2. **Investment Intelligence**: Market understanding, strategy modeling, and decision-making
3. **Execution Intelligence**: Order optimization, brokerage integration, and execution verification
4. **Natural Language Interface**: Conversational interaction, intent understanding, and explanation generation
5. **User Experience & Interface**: Dashboard, visualization, feedback collection, and mobile experience
6. **Testing & Operations**: Quality assurance, deployment, monitoring, and scaling

Each workstream progresses through three phases of development, ensuring a modular, extensible architecture that can evolve over time while maintaining a cohesive agent experience.

## Getting Started

Development of the MENTOR agent is organized into a 15-month implementation plan with five major milestones:

1. **Foundation** (Months 1-3): Core architecture and basic capabilities
2. **Intelligence** (Months 4-6): Enhanced learning and execution
3. **Learning & Adaptation** (Months 7-9): Advanced learning and multi-modal capabilities
4. **Expansion & Optimization** (Months 10-12): Multi-broker support and performance optimization
5. **Beta & Refinement** (Months 13-15): Beta testing, refinement, and launch preparation

## Development Status

The project is currently in the initial planning and architecture phase. The next step is to begin implementation of Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture).
