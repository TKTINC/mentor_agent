# MENTOR Agent Resume Prompt

## Project Overview

MENTOR (Market Execution & Navigation Through Optimized Reasoning) is a personal investment agent platform that learns each user's unique investment philosophy and executes it perfectly on their behalf. Unlike traditional robo-advisors or trading platforms that impose specific strategies, MENTOR begins with sophisticated financial capabilities but zero investment philosophy, adapting to any user's approach through conversation, demonstration, and feedback.

The core innovation is maintaining user ownership of investment strategy while eliminating execution friction and emotional barriers - solving the fundamental tension in investment technology.

## Current Project Status

We have completed the initial planning and architecture phase for the MENTOR agent, including:

1. **Concept Synthesis**: Comprehensive analysis of the platform's unique value proposition, market opportunity, and competitive differentiation
2. **Project Structure**: Defined six workstreams with three phases each following the agent-oriented iAI framework
3. **Implementation Plan**: Created a detailed 15-month roadmap with specific milestones and deliverables
4. **Documentation**: Prepared foundational documentation for all aspects of the project

The project is now ready to begin implementation of Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture).

## Repository Structure

The MENTOR agent repository is organized as follows:

```

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the MENTOR agent project are:

1. **Repository Setup**: Create and initialize the GitHub repository with the defined structure
2. **Development Environment**: Set up Docker-based local development environment
3. **Core Architecture**: Begin implementation of the base agent framework with perception-cognition-action loop
4. **Initial Components**: Develop basic memory system and natural language understanding
5. **Market Data**: Implement initial market data processing capabilities

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **LLM Integration**: Using OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude for natural language understanding
2. **Learning Engine**: Vector databases (Pinecone/Weaviate) for user preference modeling
3. **Brokerage Integration**: Starting with Interactive Brokers API, then expanding to others
4. **Development Approach**: Modular, agent-oriented architecture with clear interfaces
5. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing with simulation capabilities

## Core Value Proposition

MENTOR solves the universal tension in investment technology through:

1. **Philosophy Agnosticism**: Adapts to any investment approach rather than imposing a specific strategy
2. **Execution Translation**: Converts simple investment ideas into perfectly executed trades
3. **Emotional Discipline**: Maintains the user's strategy during market volatility
4. **Time Liberation**: Monitors markets 24/7 for opportunities matching user criteria
5. **Learning Partnership**: Continuously improves understanding of user preferences

## Target Market

The initial focus will be on:

1. **Options Traders**: Highest execution friction and clear value proposition
2. **Active Self-Directed Investors**: Trade frequently, have developed personal strategies
3. **Time-Constrained Professionals**: High income, investment knowledge, but limited time

## Implementation Timeline

The project follows a 15-month implementation timeline:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Months 1-3): Core architecture and basic capabilities
2. **Phase 2: Intelligence** (Months 4-6): Enhanced learning and execution
3. **Phase 3: Learning & Adaptation** (Months 7-9): Advanced learning and multi-modal capabilities
4. **Phase 4: Expansion & Optimization** (Months 10-12): Multi-broker support and performance optimization
5. **Phase 5: Beta & Refinement** (Months 13-15): Beta testing, refinement, and launch preparation

## Resuming Development

When resuming development of the MENTOR agent project, please:

1. Review the project structure and implementation plan documents
2. Check the current status in the todo.md file
3. Examine the most recent implementation responses
4. Continue with the next planned tasks according to the workstream and phase structure

The agent-oriented iAI framework guides all development, with a focus on learning capabilities, execution intelligence, and user experience. The goal is to build a platform that can adapt to any investment approach rather than imposing a specific strategy.
