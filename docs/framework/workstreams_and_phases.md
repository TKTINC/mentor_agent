# MENTOR Agent: Workstreams and Phases

## Overview

The MENTOR (Market Execution & Navigation Through Optimized Reasoning) agent project is structured following the agent-oriented iAI framework, with six core workstreams each progressing through three phases of development. This structure ensures a modular, extensible architecture that can evolve over time while maintaining a cohesive agent experience.

## Workstreams

### Workstream 1: Agent Foundation
**Focus**: Core architecture, memory systems, and learning framework

This workstream establishes the fundamental agent architecture, including the perception-cognition-action loop, memory systems, and learning capabilities. It provides the foundation upon which all other workstreams build.

### Workstream 2: Investment Intelligence
**Focus**: Market understanding, strategy modeling, and decision-making

This workstream develops the agent's ability to understand market data, model investment philosophies, and make decisions aligned with user preferences. It enables the agent to translate investment intent into execution plans.

### Workstream 3: Execution Intelligence
**Focus**: Order optimization, brokerage integration, and execution verification

This workstream implements the agent's ability to construct optimal orders, integrate with brokerage APIs, and verify execution. It ensures that investment decisions are executed perfectly.

### Workstream 4: Natural Language Interface
**Focus**: Conversational interaction, intent understanding, and explanation generation

This workstream creates the agent's ability to understand investment intent expressed in natural language, maintain context-aware conversations, and explain its reasoning clearly to users.

### Workstream 5: User Experience & Interface
**Focus**: Dashboard, visualization, feedback collection, and mobile experience

This workstream develops the user-facing components of the agent, including portfolio visualization, preference management, and cross-platform experience.

### Workstream 6: Testing & Operations
**Focus**: Quality assurance, deployment, monitoring, and scaling

This workstream ensures the reliability, security, and scalability of the agent, including comprehensive testing, monitoring, and operational infrastructure.

## Development Phases

Each workstream progresses through three phases of development, with increasing sophistication and capability:

### Phase 1: Core Capabilities
**Focus**: Establishing basic functionality and infrastructure

This phase implements the fundamental capabilities required for each workstream, creating a minimal viable product that demonstrates the core value proposition.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence
**Focus**: Adding sophistication and integration

This phase enhances the basic capabilities with more advanced features, deeper integration between components, and improved intelligence.

### Phase 3: Advanced Adaptation
**Focus**: Adding learning, optimization, and advanced features

This phase implements advanced learning capabilities, optimization techniques, and sophisticated features that enable the agent to continuously improve through experience.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a phased approach across all workstreams:

1. **Foundation (Months 1-3)**: Implement Phase 1 of all workstreams
2. **Intelligence (Months 4-6)**: Implement Phase 2 of all workstreams
3. **Learning & Adaptation (Months 7-9)**: Implement Phase 3 of all workstreams
4. **Expansion & Optimization (Months 10-12)**: Enhance and optimize all components
5. **Beta & Refinement (Months 13-15)**: Conduct beta testing and refine based on feedback

This approach ensures that the agent maintains a balanced development across all capabilities while progressively enhancing its intelligence and adaptation.
