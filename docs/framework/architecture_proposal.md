# MENTOR Agent Architecture Proposal

## Overview

MENTOR (Market Execution & Navigation Through Optimized Reasoning) is a personal investment agent platform that learns each user's unique investment philosophy and executes it perfectly on their behalf. This document outlines the architectural approach for implementing MENTOR following the agent-oriented iAI framework.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Philosophy Agnosticism
The architecture must support learning and executing any investment approach rather than imposing a specific strategy. This requires a flexible cognitive system that can represent diverse investment philosophies.

### 2. Learning-First Design
All components must be designed to improve through experience, with explicit feedback loops and learning objectives throughout the system.

### 3. Agent-Oriented Structure
The system follows the agent-oriented iAI framework with perception-cognition-action loop, rather than traditional microservice architecture.

### 4. Modular Components
Clear interfaces between components enable independent development and testing while maintaining system cohesion.

### 5. Progressive Autonomy
The system should support increasing levels of autonomy as user trust develops, with appropriate safeguards and transparency.
